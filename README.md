This is a simple Cornish-language roguelike based on the libtcod Python tutorial [here](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod), which also contains installation instructions for the libtcod library for Python.

Note that there is an [issue](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1207405/fmod-after-an-update-to-windows-2004-is-causing-a.html) with the latest numpy in 64-bit Python. I ran `pip install numpy==1.19.3` after installing libtcod which fixed it.

Run the program with `python engine.py`
